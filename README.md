# MasterMind-The-Game
## Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game for two players. The modern game with pegs was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert.
## The game here is a web based implementation of the above using python.
## The design is not very fancy as I made it just for practice and to use python as a script.
